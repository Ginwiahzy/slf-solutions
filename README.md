# Separation Logic Foundation Solutions
This repository includes my personal solution to the _Separation Logic Foundation_ (i.e. Volume 6 of _Software Foundations_).

Materials can be found [here](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/slf-current/index.html). The version of the book I use is 1.3 (2022-08-08 17:30, Coq 8.15 or later)
